# Keylogger

In this implementation of the keylogger, the main idea is to create a fake browser page. I have implemented it for *Microsoft Edge*, but you can change it from the source code.

## Installation

You can easily install the keylogger by either cloning the repository

    git clone https://github.com/camarman/keylogger.git

or via downloading as ZIP. Later on, you can simply run

    python3 -m pip install pynput

to install the requirements.

## Disclaimer

This tool is for educational purposes only. The usage of a keylogger for attacking targets without prior mutual consent is illegal. I accept no liability and responsibility for any misuse or damage caused by this program.
